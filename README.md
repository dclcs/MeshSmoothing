## Mesh Smoothing


- Noise is high frequencies
- Overall shape the low frequencies

- Smoothing : create an approximating function that attempts to capture 
    important patterns in the data, while leaving out noise or other 
    fine-scale structures/rapid phenomena
    
    
- Filter-based methods
